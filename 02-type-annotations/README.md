# DAY 2: Type annotations

1. Understand the importance of type annotations in improving code clarity, catching bugs, and enhancing IDE support.
2. Download the given before.py file from here and ensure you have the Python language extension installed in your VS Code editor.
3. Set the type checking mode to “strict” in your editor’s settings.json file.
   `"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict"`
4. Open the before.py file and observe the type errors flagged by the IDE.
5. Write type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return values in the code without changing its functionality.
6. Ensure that all type errors identified by the IDE are resolved after adding the annotations.
7. Keep the type annotations as generic as possible, avoiding extra limitations on function usage.
8. Do not use the “Any” type in this challenge.
9. Verify that the code runs without errors after adding the type annotations.
10. Submit your solution and verify that all type errors have been eliminated, maintaining the code’s original functionality.
