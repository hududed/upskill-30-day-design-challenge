# DAY 9: Plugin architecture

Task 1: Understand the current codebase

- Review the existing codebase and understand how the payment methods are currently implemented and used in the main.py file.
- Identify the parts of the code that need modification to support the plugin mechanism for adding new payment methods.

Task 2: Design the plugin mechanism

- Plan the design for the plugin mechanism that allows adding new payment methods without modifying the main.py file.
- Determine the structure and format of the plugin scripts.
- Decide on a suitable location (e.g., plugins folder) to store the plugin scripts.

Task 3: Create a new payment method plugin

- Create a new Python script containing the code for the payment method that needs to be added.
- Ensure that the script follows the required structure and format for the plugin.

Task 4: Implement the plugin loading mechanism

- Modify the main.py file to include a plugin loading mechanism.
- Use importlib and os.walk to dynamically load the payment method plugins from the plugins folder.

Task 5: Test the plugin functionality

- Run the main.py file and verify that the newly added payment method plugin is recognized and available to the user.
- Test the functionality of the new payment method and ensure it works as expected.

Task 6: Refactor the code structure

- Consider splitting the code into separate files to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Create a separate file to manage the loading and accessing of plugins.

Task 7: Test and verify code decoupling

- Add additional payment method plugins and verify that they can be used without modifying the main.py file.
- Ensure that the main.py file remains relatively small and only handles the core functionality.

Task 8: Document the changes made

- Document the modifications made to the codebase to support the plugin mechanism for adding payment methods.
- Explain the design approach used and the benefits of decoupling the code from the main.py file.
- Provide instructions on how to add new payment method plugins in the future.
