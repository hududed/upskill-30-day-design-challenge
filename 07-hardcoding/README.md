# DAY 7: Avoiding Hardcoding

Task 1: Understand the current discount system implementation

- Review the existing codebase and understand how the discount system is currently implemented using inheritance.
- Identify the specific issues with the hardcoded discount codes and the limitations of the current design.

Task 2: Design a flexible discount system

- Plan a new design for the discount system that allows for easy addition of new discount codes without modifying the core ShoppingCart class.
- Consider alternative design patterns such as the Strategy pattern or the Decorator pattern to decouple the discount logic from the ShoppingCart class.

Task 3: Refactor the code to incorporate the new discount system

- Modify the existing code to integrate the redesigned discount system.
- Implement the necessary changes to remove the hardcoded discount codes and provide a more flexible and extensible solution.

Task 4: Test the refactored code

- Run tests to ensure that the new discount system works as expected.
- Verify that the ShoppingCart class correctly applies discounts based on the provided discount codes.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the changes did not introduce any new bugs or issues.

Task 5: Document the changes made

- Document the areas of code that were modified to implement the redesigned discount system.
- Explain the new design approach used, including the design pattern employed and how it improves flexibility and simplicity.
- Provide instructions on how to add new discount codes and utilize the discount system.
