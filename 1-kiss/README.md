Challenge: Write a Python function called **`count_fruits`** that counts the frequency of each type of fruit in a given list of strings. Return a dictionary where the keys are fruit names and the values are their respective counts. The code should be simple and straightforward.

Solution:

- Download the provided code for the challenge.
- Write a function named **`count_fruits`** that takes a list of strings as input.
- Initialize an empty dictionary to store the fruit counts.
- Iterate over each fruit in the input list.
  - If the fruit is already a key in the dictionary, increment its count by 1.
  - If the fruit is not a key in the dictionary, add it as a key with a count of 1.
- Return the resulting dictionary of fruit counts.

Testing:

- Add tests to ensure the function works correctly.
- You can use Python's built-in **`unittest`** package or add assertions to the main function.

Reflection:

- Reflect on the simplicity and straightforwardness of your solution.
- Consider if there is a simpler approach to solve the problem.
- Evaluate if you have used appropriate language features and constructs effectively.
