# DAY 4: DRY principles

Task 1: Identify code repetition

- Analyze the provided codebase and understand its structure and functionality.
- Look for patterns or sections of code that are repeated in multiple places.
- Identify at least three instances where code repetition occurs.

Task 2: Refactor the code

- Determine the reusable code elements that can be created to eliminate repetition.
- Create functions or modules that encapsulate the duplicated logic or functionality.
- Modify the existing code to call and utilize these reusable elements instead of repeating the code.

Task 3: Test the refactored code

- Verify that the refactored code produces the same results as the original code.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the changes did not introduce any new bugs or issues.
- Validate that the refactored code is more maintainable and adheres to the DRY principle.

Task 4: Document the changes

- Document the areas of code where repetition was identified and the corresponding refactorings made.
- Describe the new reusable code elements and how they are used in place of the repetitive code.
- Explain the benefits of the refactored code, such as improved readability, maintainability, and reduced redundancy.

Task 5: Submit the solution

- Package the refactored code along with the documentation of changes.
- Submit the solution to the appropriate platform or person who issued the challenge.
- Provide any additional instructions or information required for reviewing the solution.
